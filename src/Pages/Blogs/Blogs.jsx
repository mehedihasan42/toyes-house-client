                <p className='mt-4'>An access token and a refresh token are commonly used in authentication and authorization systems. Here's
                    an explanation of what they are, how they work, and where they should be stored on the client-side.</p>
                <p><span className='font-bold'>Access Token:</span>
                    An access token is a credential that is used to access protected resources on behalf of a user.
                    It is typically a short-lived token with an expiration time. When a user authenticates and receives an
                    access token, they include it in subsequent API requests to prove their identity and gain access to protected
                    resources. The server validates the access token to ensure the user has the necessary permissions.</p>
                <p><span className='font-bold'>Refresh Token:</span>
                    A refresh token is a long-lived credential used to obtain a new access token when the current access
                    token expires. It is usually issued alongside the access token during the initial authentication process.
                    When the access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to a token endpoint on the server.
                    If the refresh token is valid, the server generates a new access token and returns it to the client.
                    This process allows the user to maintain their session without needing to re-authenticate every time the
                    access token expires.</p>

                <p><span className='font-bold'>Express JS:</span>
                    Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of
                    features and tools for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process
                    of creating server-side applications by providing a minimalistic, unopinionated framework
                    that allows developers to structure their applications as they see fit.</p>
                <p><span className='font-bold'>Nest JS:</span>
                    NestJS is a progressive and powerful framework for building efficient and scalable
                    server-side applications using TypeScript. It is built on top of Express.js and leverages
                    the features of TypeScript to provide a structured and organized approach to developing
                    Node.js applications.</p>

               <p>
                In MongoDB, the aggregate operation is a powerful feature that allows you to perform advanced data
                 processing and analysis tasks on collections of documents. It enables you to perform complex data
                  transformations, aggregations, and computations within the database.</p>
